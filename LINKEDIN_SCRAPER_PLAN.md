## Technical Implementation Details for v2.0.0

### Data Extraction Strategy

#### 1. DOM-based Extraction
New selectors to implement:
```python
# Company Information Selectors
'company_linkedin_url': '//a[contains(@href, "/company/")]/@href',
'company_logo': '//img[contains(@class, "company-logo")]/@src',
'company_description': '//div[contains(@class, "company-description")]/text()',
'company_address': '//div[contains(@class, "company-address")]',
'company_website': '//a[contains(@class, "company-website")]/@href',
'company_slogan': '//p[contains(@class, "company-slogan")]/text()',
'company_employee_count': '//div[contains(@class, "company-size")]/text()',

# Enhanced Job Details
'job_poster_info': '//div[contains(@class, "poster-information")]',
'easy_apply': '//button[contains(@class, "easy-apply")]',
'job_workplace_type': '//span[contains(@class, "workplace-type")]/text()',
'job_state': '//span[contains(@class, "job-state")]/text()',

# Applicant Insights
'applicant_count': '//span[contains(@class, "applicant-count")]/text()',
'applicant_insights': '//div[contains(@class, "applicant-insights")]',

# Salary Information
'salary_range': '//span[contains(@class, "salary-range")]/text()',

# Skills & Requirements
'required_skills': '//ul[contains(@class, "required-skills")]/li/text()',
```

#### 2. JSON Data Extraction
LinkedIn embeds rich data in script tags that can be extracted:
```python
def extract_json_data(response):
    # Find script tags with job data
    script_data = response.xpath('//script[contains(text(), "jobPostingInfo")]/text()').get()
    if script_data:
        # Extract the JSON data using regex
        import re
        match = re.search(r'(\{.*?\})(?=;)', script_data)
        if match:
            import json
            try:
                data = json.loads(match.group(1))
                return data
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                return None
    return None
```

#### 3. Enhanced Item Model
```python
class EnhancedLinkedInJobItem(scrapy.Item):
    # Basic job information (existing)
    id = scrapy.Field()
    title = scrapy.Field()
    companyName = scrapy.Field()
    location = scrapy.Field()
    descriptionText = scrapy.Field()
    applyUrl = scrapy.Field()
    postedAt = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Enhanced company information
    companyLinkedinUrl = scrapy.Field()
    companyLogo = scrapy.Field()
    companyDescription = scrapy.Field()
    companyAddress = scrapy.Field()
    companyWebsite = scrapy.Field()
    companySlogan = scrapy.Field()
    companyEmployeesCount = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Enhanced job details
    isReposted = scrapy.Field()
    posterId = scrapy.Field()
    insights = scrapy.Field()
    easyApply = scrapy.Field()
    isPromoted = scrapy.Field()
    link = scrapy.Field()
    insightsV2 = scrapy.Field()
    postedAtTimestamp = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Applicant insights
    jobApplicantInsights = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Job workplace types
    jobWorkplaceTypes = scrapy.Field()
    jobState = scrapy.Field()
    contentSource = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Recruiter information
    recruiter = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Company detailed information
    company = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Salary information
    salary = scrapy.Field()
    
    # Skills
    skills = scrapy.Field()
```

- Create automated tests to detect structure changes

#### Data Availability Variance
**Challenge**: Not all jobs have the same data available
**Mitigation**:
- Implement graceful handling of missing data
- Provide default values where appropriate
- Document data availability patterns

#### Performance Impact
**Challenge**: Extracting more data may slow down the scraping process
**Mitigation**:
- Implement configurable extraction levels
- Optimize extraction order
- Add caching for repeated data

#### Rate Limiting
**Challenge**: More complex scraping might trigger LinkedIn's anti-scraping measures
**Mitigation**:
- Implement adaptive rate limiting
- Add delay configuration
- Support proxy rotation
