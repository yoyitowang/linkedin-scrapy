## Features

### Version 1.0 (MVP) - Current Implementation Target

## Technical Considerations

### Anti-Detection Measures
- Use realistic user agents
- Implement random delays between requests
- Handle cookies properly
- Mimic human browsing patterns

### LinkedIn Specific Challenges
- LinkedIn has strong anti-scraping measures
- The site requires authentication for most job details
- Page structure may change frequently
- Rate limiting can be aggressive

### Ethical and Legal Considerations
- Respect robots.txt
- Don't overload the LinkedIn servers
- Only use data in accordance with LinkedIn's terms of service
- Consider implementing a user-agent that identifies your scraper

## Usage Instructions
1. Install requirements
2. Configure LinkedIn credentials
3. Set search parameters
4. Run the spider
5. Retrieve output data
